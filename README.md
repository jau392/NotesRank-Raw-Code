# NotesRank-Raw-Code
The code (mostly PHP) with which I implemented my web application, NotesRank.

Read more about the purpose and inspiration for this website on my LinkedIn and résumé. Essentially, it is a platform with which college students may
leverage their own competitiveness into a universal good which saves all participants time and effort, yet optimizes the efficiency of learning itself. Qualified
participants upload their notes submissions, vying for the top 3 spots which earn them a small, yet nontrivial, reward. These notes are then edited and
woven together wiki-style into a final version.
