                    <p>
                        With NotesRank, garnering information and learning from lecture has never been more efficient. Instead of induidualizing note-taking, NotesRank participants all submit PDF's of their notes then score each of peers' uploads 1 to 10. The top 3 most useful notes will then be displayed, on which students may then comment in traditional forum format. Register and qualify today, and leave 2021 the last year you ever wondered what to study for an exam!
